###Maestro is the main object or interface for the Nano Framework.
<p>It is time to take control of your web applications. There are plenty of
libraries and frameworks out there but none are designed to work together.
That is where Nano Framework comes in. We decided on Bootstrap for document
structure and flow and jQuery for JavaScript coding. We have also added
Modernizr for maximum compatibility and Font-Awesome for even more fonts.
</p>
<p>So what is the difference? Well, we turned Bootstrap, jQuery, Font-Awesome 
and Modernizr into a Black Box for developers. You never have to worry about 
optimized loading order, multiple copies loaded, nothing. Maestro takes care 
of all of that.
