			<p>It is time to take control of your web applications. There are plenty of
			libraries and frameworks out there but none are designed to work together.
			That is where Nano Framework comes in. We decided on Bootstrap for document
			structure and flow and jQuery for JavaScript coding. We have also added
			Modernizr for maximum compatibility and Font-Awesome for even more fonts.
			</p>
			<p>So what is the difference? Well, we turned Bootstrap, jQuery, Font-Awesome 
			and Modernizr into a Black Box for developers. You never have to worry about 
			optimized loading order, multiple copies loaded, nothing. Maestro takes care 
			of all of that.

			<h2 style="width:100%;float:none;clear: both">There are two ways in which you can load and use the the Nano Framework:</h2>
			
			<h3>Normal Web Document Mode</h3>
			<p>
			This gives you Modernizr, Bootstrap, jQuery, Font-awesome and the Nano Framework
			but the the Nano framework will just load the libraries efficiently in the order
			and location they belong. It will not parse the CloudApp Configuration JSON so the
			framework will terminate execution, but you have access if you want to use this and
			that. So at the very least you can use ONE line of code to load all popular libraries
			and just start coding.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Nano CloudApp Mode</h3>
			<p>
			This mode will handle just about everything for you. Loading the libraries, creating and
			embedding the correct meta tags including Author, Copyright with auto date update for year,
			etc. It also provides local storage for application, publish, global and user settings and
			information. Applets for Rapid Application development - Applets have their styling and
			JavaScript embedded with them and they are encoded and compressed into a package. Applets
			can be included with a single line of code. You also get access to the Game Library (2DGL)
			Layouts, Skins Smart Color, Dynamic Configurations and more.
