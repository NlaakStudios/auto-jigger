/*
The HEAD below is the minimum example. You may still run a CloudApp or RRWD page. Below
are a lists of what you can and cannot do.

- You *Cannot* Use jQuery; obviously - it's not loaded.
- You *Do not* have the features for Modernizr; basically you lost all support for IE (which we don't support)

- You *WILL* have waDIV & waCANVAS elements available
- You *WILL* have 100% access to the H5C3 Framework

See also:
	config.js	for more detailed information ont he configuration file
	HEAD.js		for the suggested HEAD for your document
	BODY.js		for the suggested BODY for your document
	HTML.js		for the suggested HTML document
	
(start code)
	<head>
		<title>Webpage Title</title>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
		<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/default.css" type="text/css" title="Style" />
		<script src="http://h5c3.i2tmlabs.com/js/gamecore.min.js" title="gameCore"></script>
		<script src="js/config.js" title="config"></script>
	</head>
(end)

You can also load the debug version if you are activly developing by doing changing the last line to

>	<script src="http://h5c3.i2tmlabs.com/js/h5c3.debug.min.js" title="h5c3"></script>				

Notice that you never actually load the H5C3 Framework. This is actually handled by the last line of the configuration file.
All that is required is the config.js file. You are meant to actually name the config after your page or app. See the below examples:

(start code)

The above filesystem is my actual development structure. H5C3 Framework is deigned for the Cloud right fromt he start, nothing is installed; so
all CloudApps and resources will be on the i2tmlabs.com servers. You can still run the CloudApps and RRWD from you domains, it is seamless like 
Google adSense or Analytics.

However, lets say your name John Smith and your own "The Best Software Publisher, Inc." and sign up for the H5C3 Framework Developer account. You
WILL be making money off your hard work, but at the moment you are not. You are just learning and developing.

Well her you go Mr. Tablespoon, Your Commercial account file structure. The dev folder is internal to you and your developers.
The live folder is Puclic access, wha you currently have online.

Welcome to your CloudApps folder. It could look simular to the one below.

(end)

Below you will find your directory structure for your Qoqqle- CloudApp. This was cis created for you automatically for the
H5C3 Builder UI. Pull it, Add it to your respository - your ready to develop. You can develop locally, but need internet 
an internet connect for access to the H5C3 Framework (Which is *NOT* authorized off i2tmlabs.com). 
Plugins and other resources are fine to pull to your local file system.
