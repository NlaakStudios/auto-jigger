The above filesystem is my actual development structure. H5C3 Framework is deigned for the Cloud right from the start, nothing is installed; so
all CloudApps and resources will be on the i2tmlabs.com servers. You can still run the CloudApps and RRWD from you domains, it is seamless like 
Google adSense or Analytics.

However, lets say your name John Smith and your own "The Best Software Publisher, Inc." and sign up for the H5C3 Framework Developer account. You
WILL be making money off your hard work, but at the moment you are not. You are just learning and developing.

When you are ready you submit the 
fruits of your labor and apply for a Business Account and you request it under BIZ.

Well her you go Mr. Tablespoon, Your Commercial account file structure. The dev folder is internal to you and your developers.
The live folder is Puclic access, wha you currently have online.

Welcome to your CloudApps folder. It could look simular to the one below.

/h5c3/apps/biz/TBSP/live/apps

(end)

Below you will find your directory structure for your Qoqqle- CloudApp. This was cis created for you automatically for the
H5C3 Builder UI. Pull it, Add it to your respository - your ready to develop. You can develop locally, but need internet 
an internet connect for access to the H5C3 Framework (Which is *NOT* authorized off i2tmlabs.com). 
Plugins and other resources are fine to pull to your local file system.
