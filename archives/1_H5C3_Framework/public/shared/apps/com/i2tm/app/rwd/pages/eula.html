<h1>14. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. </h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>This software cannot damage hardware and therefore you
cannot recover from I2TM Labs and its suppliers for damages including consequential,
lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages. This limitation applies
to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•     Anything related to the software, services, content
(including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•     claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•     I2TM Labs knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other
damages. </p>

<h1>LIMITED WARRANTY</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a.    LIMITED WARRANTY.  If you follow the instructions and
the software is properly licensed, the software will perform substantially as
described in the I2TM Labs materials that you receive in or with the software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b.    TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTIES. The limited warranty covers the software for one year after
acquired by the first user. If you receive supplements, updates, or replacement
software during that year, they will be covered for the remainder of the
warranty or 30 days, whichever is longer. If the first user transfers the
software, the remainder of the warranty will apply to the recipient. To the
extent permitted by law, any implied warranties, guarantees or conditions last
only during the term of the limited warranty. Some states do not allow
limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not
apply to you. They also might not apply to you because some countries may not
allow limitations on how long an implied warranty, guarantee or condition
lasts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>c.     EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY. This warranty does not
cover problems caused by your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or
events beyond <b>I2TM Labs’</b> reasonable control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>d.    REMEDY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. I2TM Labs will repair
or replace the software at no charge. If <b>I2TM Labs</b> cannot repair or
replace it, I2TM Labs will refund the amount shown on your receipt for the
software. It will also repair or replace supplements, updates and replacement
software at no charge. If I2TM Labs cannot repair or replace them, it will
refund the amount you paid for them, if any. You must uninstall the software
and return any media and other associated materials to I2TM Labs with proof of
purchase to obtain a refund. These are your only remedies for breach of the
limited warranty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>e.    CONSUMER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED. You may have additional
consumer rights under your local laws, which this agreement cannot change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>f.     WARRANTY PROCEDURES. You need a licensed account as
proof for warranty service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>g.    NO OTHER WARRANTIES. The limited warranty is the only
direct warranty from I2TM Labs. I2TM Labs gives no other express warranties,
guarantees or conditions. Where allowed by your local laws, I2TM Labs excludes
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement. If you’re local laws give you any implied warranties,
guarantees or conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described
in the Remedy for Breach of Warranty clause above, to the extent permitted by
your local laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>h.    LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF
WARRANTY. The Limitation on and Exclusion of Damages clause above applies to
breaches of this limited warranty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i.      This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and
you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. You may also
have other rights which vary from country to country.</p>
