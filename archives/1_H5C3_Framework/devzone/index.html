<p>
It  has   been   two    decades
since    the    internet    was
born.   With   it   came   alot
of   good...  but  plenty    of
misery    as well.
</p>						    				
							    
<p>							   	
Even   though   the   days   of 
double    clicking   your   AOL
icon  to  connect,  then     go
off    and    have    breakfast
and  then  come   back....  are
a    thing   of    the    past;
Even   though   there  is  tons
of     information,      games,
social    networking    and  so
on, none     of     it    plays
nice   with   eachother.   None
bring    the   full   enjoyable
experience   of   entertainment
</p>

<p>
We     here     at   i2tm  Labs
have     spent    the      last
year  developing   a  whole new
way    to     experience    the
web    and    even      develop
software    for    the     web.
</p>

<p>
We   call    this   new    100%
cloud   based    platform   the
H5C3    Framework    and    you
can   learn    more  about  it,
the     technological      edge
it   provides    for  both  the
consumer   and  the   developer
after    this   cheezy   1980's
introduction    is   complete.
</p>

<p>
LOL!   Just   joking   we   are
done.  Please  take  a   moment
to    look   into    what    we
will    have    to    offer. If
you are   or   want    to    be
a  web     developer,    please
feel  free   to    request    a
developer  or    beta    tester
account.
