			<h1 class="h5c3Stamped">H5C3 Framework is arriving...</h1>
			<p>After many months of development we have a HTML5 &amp; CSS3 compliant Framework that provides a way of creating CloudApps that work on Mobile devices, Desktops and Even Game consoles.</p>
			<p>We have designed the H5C3 Framework around the Google Chromium Framework. No other browser is currently supported at this time. The reason for this is quite simple...Google Chrome just works, flawlessy with all W3C standards. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari and the others all issues and or bugs which even though a work around could be done...it would diminish your overall experience with our services and applications.</p>
			<h1 class="h5c3Stamped">What is a CloudApp?</h1>
			<p>CloudApps are are born, live thier lives and die on the server. There is no need for the developers to maintain computer systems, backups, write installers, updaters, etc. The DevPortal provides for Project management, version tracking, support desk, Online IDE, Bulding, Sandbox, everything a developer needs.</p>
