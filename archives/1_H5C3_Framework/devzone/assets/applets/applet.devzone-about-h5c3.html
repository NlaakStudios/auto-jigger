						<p>Martin Wells at <a href="http://playcraftlabs.com/">PlayCraft Labs</a> got me hooked almost a year ago with his HTML5 Game Library, I had a great asteroids on steroids in no time that they actually used at a Game Convention. 
						If you are targeting game development directly, definately go take a look at PlayCraft Labs.
						
						Gamecore which is a underlying OOP framework with some added utility functions like for Class/Object naming, String manipulation, logging, etc. At the time I forked off Gamecore was still integrated into the PlayCraftJS engine, so I extracted it and then spent the next few weeks looking at other OOP frameworks, and even started writing one of my own with the best from all over. However it was turning into the Gamecore LOL.
						
						After that, i realized that that boring old browsers of the past were gone. We are facing new a era and I desperately wanted to help lay the path or framework for this new era. </p>
						<p>So in November 2012 I forked Playcraft v0.5.6 and and set off to develop a full blown Rapid Application Development (RAD) framework that existed soley on the internet or "Cloud". Since then I have developed three seperate technologies or layers as I refer to them that make up the foundation of the H5C3 Framework.</p>
