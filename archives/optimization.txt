<meta http-equiv="Cache-control" content="public">
The value in the content field is defined as one of the four values below.

Some information on the Cache-Control header is as follows

HTTP 1.1. Allowed values = PUBLIC | PRIVATE | NO-CACHE | NO-STORE.

Public - may be cached in public shared caches.
Private - may only be cached in private cache.
No-Cache - may not be cached.
No-Store - may be cached but not archived.

The directive CACHE-CONTROL:NO-CACHE indicates cached information should not be used and instead requests should be forwarded to the origin server. This directive has the same semantics as the PRAGMA:NO-CACHE.

Clients SHOULD include both PRAGMA: NO-CACHE and CACHE-CONTROL: NO-CACHE when a no-cache request is sent to a server not known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. Also see EXPIRES.
